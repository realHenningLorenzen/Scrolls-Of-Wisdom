# :scroll: Henning's scrolls of wisdom :scroll:

## Preface

After ~looting~ collecting wisdom from the internet in _hundreds_ of browser
tabs and bookmarks over the last years, I chose to slowly work through them and
either share them in this place in an opinionated and maybe curated manner (or
delete them).

## R

- For useRs, the origin of everything is [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

- Or [RStudio PBC](https://www.rstudio.com/).

- [Shiny Developer Series](https://shinydevseries.com/) podcasts (and occasional
  live streams).

- [Rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org/) provides docker images for R.

- [rseek](https://rseek.org/) is the best way to search R-related content.
  Downside: it is a Google front-end. \
  [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) offers the "bang"
  [`!rseek`](https://duckduckgo.com/bang?q=rseek)...

- Microsoft (which acquired *Revolutions* in 2015) hosts

  - [Revolutions Blog](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/)

  - [MRAN](https://mran.microsoft.com/), including

    - [CRAN time machine](https://mran.microsoft.com/timemachine)

    - [Microsoft R Open](https://mran.microsoft.com/download)

- Read [The R Inferno](https://www.burns-stat.com/documents/books/the-r-inferno/)
  to learn about R's gotchas. :nerd_face:

- [Awesome R](https://github.com/qinwf/awesome-R) list of packages and tools

### My opinionated list of R packages

- [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) meta-package, notorious components are
  - [magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/) pipe operator `%>%` (I think I
    could not live with it anymore :grin:)

- [R infrastructure](https://github.com/r-lib)
  - [rlang](https://rlang.r-lib.org/) programming on the language :nerd_face:
  - much more...


- [renv](https://cran.r-project.org/package=renv) - freeze package versions for
  reproducibility on project-level.

- [checkpoint](https://cran.r-project.org/package=checkpoint) - use MRAN's CRAN
  time machine to freeze package versions.

- Want to play with SQL? [RSQLite](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RSQLite)!

- [here](https://here.r-lib.org/) - robust handling of relative paths.

- The famous [rmarkdown](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmarkdown): embed R
  code in markdown syntax :arrow_right: `.Rmd` and there you go (reports,
  documentation, etc.)
