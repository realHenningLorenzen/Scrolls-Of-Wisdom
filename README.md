# ðŸ“œ ðŸ“œ Henning's scrolls of wisdom ðŸ“œ ðŸ“œ
## Preface
After ~looting~ collecting wisdom from the internet in *hundreds* of browser tabs and bookmarks over the last years, I chose to slowly work through them and either share them in this place in an opinionated and maybe curated manner (or delete them).

## R

* For useRs, the origin of everything is [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
* Or at https://www.rstudio.com/...
* [Shiny Developer Series](https://shinydevseries.com/) podcasts (and occasional live streams).
* [Rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org/) provides docker images for R.
* [rseek](https://rseek.org/) is the best way to search R-related content. Downside: it is a Google front-end. \
  [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) offers the "bang" [`!rseek`](https://duckduckgo.com/bang?q=rseek)...
