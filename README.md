# ðŸ“œ ðŸ“œ Henning's scrolls of wisdom ðŸ“œ ðŸ“œ
## Preface
After ~looting~ collecting wisdom from the internet in *hundreds* of browser tabs and bookmarks over the last years, I chose to slowly work through them and either share them in this place in an opinionated and maybe curated manner (or delete them).

## R

* For useRs, the origin of everything is [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
